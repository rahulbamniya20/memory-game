# Memory Game

A classic memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where players flip cards to match pairs and earn points. The objective is to complete the game with the minimum number of flips.

      cd memory-game
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## How to Play

1. Click on any two cards to flip them over and reveal their images.
2. If the two revealed images match, the cards will remain face-up, and you will earn a point.
3. If the two revealed images do not match, the cards will flip back over, and you'll need to try again.
4. Continue flipping and matching cards until all pairs are found.
5. Your goal is to complete the game with the minimum number of moves.
